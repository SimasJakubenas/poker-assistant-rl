# Predicting Heart disease 

This is my Final Project for the studies with [codeacademy.lt](https://codeacademy.lt/) .
With this project I will be attempting to create Deep Q-Learning model that trains agents to play a 6 handed no-limit Texas Holdem poker.

## Dataset Content

## Requirements

These are the requirements for the project:
1 - Gathering my own personal game history data from a popular poker website, plotting the data on a graph and determining my win rate.

2 - Training an agent that can beat the game with higher win rate then my own.

## Hypothesis and Validation Approach

1. I myself have a positive win rate.
* Data Visualisation

2. Reinforcement Learning agent can beat my win rate.
* Deep Q-Learning Neural Network

3. Reinforcement Learning agent can beat the game after the introduction of rake (rake is a percentage a poker website takes from the money in the middle once the hand is over).
* Deep Q-Learning Neural Network

## The Rationale

**Requirement 1:** Data Visualisation
* We will gather my own hand history from a popular poker website.
* We will visualise the parsed data.

**Requirement 2:** Deep Q-Learning Neural Network
* We will create the environment to train our agents in.
* We will pre-train agents with the data we collected for 'Requirement 2'.
* We will differentiate the reward system to try and immitate different play styles.
* We will continue training agents for a significant amount of time.
* We will pick the best performing agent and eveluate the results.
